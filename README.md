# Motivation
The main aim of the project is to be a cheat sheet that contains some basic and non-basic principles of Java that seemed to me important to save for the future. The project will be constantly growing: more features will be used, more functionality will be added, more difficult classes/methods will be added to and more and more things there will be to remember, because Java is the best language in the world.

### Interfaces
The interfaces play a role of markers, their aim is to create a common feature between the enums that represent one same category. So that, we can store the enums in the same list
